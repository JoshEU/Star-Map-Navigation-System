# Star Map Navigation System #

## About: ##  
STAR MAP NAVIGATION SYSTEM is a project where you, the Astronaut has an outside perspective on space in which you can generate a chosen number of stars ranging from 5 - 50.   
Additionally, you can customize various pathfinding constraints such as:
1. **The Ships Speed**: 1 - 5
2. **Fuel Amount**: 0 - 100,000
3. **Max Jump Distance**: 1 - 10
4. **Return to Origin**: YES / NO  
    
A Star that is generated will contain the following:
- A **Spawn Location** within the pre-defined spawn location parameters
- A **Size** ranging from: Small, Medium, Large, Huge and Giant
- A random **Color**
- A **Name** that has not already been assigned to another star (50 possible names)
- Whether or not it is **Habitable**
- Its **Threat Level** ranging from: Low, Medium, High, Very High, Intense and Extreme 
- The **Number of Connections** it has ranging from: 1 - 4

As well as all this, you have the ability to roam about freely using **Dynamic View** (Press **'2'** on the keyboard to activate this) or stay in **Fixed View** (Press **'1'** on the keyboard to activate this - only works if you are currently in Dynamic View).  

Simply click stars using the Custom Cursor in order to display information about them on the **Star Description Panel** located on the  
**Right-Hand-Side** of the Screen.  
You can even select an **Origin & Destination Star** and carry out the renowned **Dijkstras Pathfinding** in order to achieve the **shortest route** from a given Origin Star to a given Destination Star.  

Also, once the shortest route has been found, hit that **Fly Ship** button in order to have a **Nav Agent Spaceship** follow the shortest route in  
real-time.  
Whilst this is happening, the **Current Pathfinding Constraints** will be displayed on the **Flying Panel** located on the **Left-Hand-Side** of the screen along with the Spaceships Current Fuel, which, if empty, **A Self-Destruct Sequence** will be initiated. **"So Watch Out!!!"**

Each Experience is **different** in this **Star Map Navigation System** as **many scenarios** can occur.  

You also have **Asteroids** and **NPC Spaceships** journeying across the solar system as you are **plotting your route**.
So what are you waiting for: Play **'STAR MAP NAVIGATION'** and may the **Best Pilot Win!**  

**"See you out in Space!"** üöÄüååüê±‚ÄçüöÄ
